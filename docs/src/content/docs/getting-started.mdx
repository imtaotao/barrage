Lunaria is an **localization management toolchain** for open-source projects, giving the tools necessary for both maintainers and contributors to build a seamless and efficient localization workflow.

## Why Lunaria?

As a maintainer, managing localization efforts has never been easy, you'd always have to sacrifice the ownership of your content by moving into a localization platform or give up on reliably tracking your content for changes, until now. Lunaria solves both of these problems by enabling an entirely new workflow, powered by Git.

Every commit to select files is used to build a localization dashboard, giving each file its respective done/outdated/missing status. From the dashboard, maintainers get a detailed overview of their project's localization status while contributors receive all the information they need to efficiently help, including links to the missing files and a list of commits that need to be added to the outdated content.

## Quick Start

### Add to your project

You can add Lunaria in your existing project by installing `@lunariajs/core` in your project's dependencies using your preferred package manager:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm install @lunariajs/core
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm install @lunariajs/core
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
yarn add @lunariajs/core
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then, you can run `lunaria init` to setup Lunaria, prompting you with a few questions and automatically filling your answers in a new `lunaria.config.json` file:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npx lunaria init
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm lunaria init
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
yarn lunaria init
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Depending of your project's structure and if you run `lunaria sync` during the initialization successfully, you might have all the requirements to build your first localization dashboard.

In case any of the fields `repository`, `defaultLocale`, `locales`, or `files` is missing in your `lunaria.config.json`, visit the [Configuration Reference guide](/reference/configuration) to set it up and then follow the instructions below.

### Build your first dashboard

To build your localization dashboard, you can run the `lunaria:build` script added by `lunaria init`:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm run lunaria:build
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm run lunaria:build
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
yarn run lunaria:build
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

By default, the localization dashboard will be built to an `index.html` file in the `./dist/lunaria/` directory. This file can then be deployed to the hosting platform of your choice and shared across your contributors.

### See it in your browser

After building your dashboard, you should be able to run `lunaria:preview` to open a new preview server on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm run lunaria:preview
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm run lunaria:preview
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
yarn run lunaria:preview
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
