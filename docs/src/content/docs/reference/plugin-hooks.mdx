Lunaria can also be used outside of its build process, allowing for integrations and other use cases through its available runtime functions.

:::caution
Lunaria exports more runtime functions than currently documented. Their behavior, as well as support is not guaranteed during public beta.
:::

## `lunaria()`

The `lunaria()` function is a way to get Lunaria's localization status during runtime. It will validate the configuration, clone your git history (if used in a shallow repository), and return a Promise of your localization status array.

```ts title="example-usage.ts"
import { lunaria } from '@lunariajs/core';

const config = {
  // your Lunaria configuration
  // ...
};

const status = await lunaria(config);
```

:::tip
You can see an example of how this function is used in the [Astro Docs' Translation Tuesday Bot](https://github.com/withastro/docs/blob/main/scripts/tuesday-bot.ts#L10).
